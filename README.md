# Recursion

## Introduction

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion) and it focuses on implementing two fundamental algorithms: generating a Fibonacci sequence and performing a merge sort on an array. These exercises aim to enhance understanding of both iterative and recursive approaches, as well as sorting algorithms.

## Fibonacci Sequence

### Iterative approach

-   The fibs function generates Fibonacci numbers iteratively.
-   It takes a number 'num' as input and returns an array containing the first 'num' numbers from the Fibonacci sequence.
-   Example: For input 8, the function returns [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].

### Recursive Approach

-   The fibsRec function generates Fibonacci numbers recursively.
-   Takes a number 'num' as input and returns an array containing the first 'num' numbers from the Fibonacci sequence.

## Merge Sort

### Overview

-   Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm for sorting arrays.
-   It divides the array into smaller sub-arrays, sorts them recursively, and then merges them back together in a sorted manner.
